    @section intro Introduction

    OCHamcrest is an Objective-C framework for writing matcher objects, allowing you to
    declaratively define "match" rules. There are a number of situations where matchers are
    invaluable, such as UI validation or data filtering, but it is in the area of writing flexible
    tests that matchers are most commonly used. This tutorial shows you how to use OCHamcrest for
    unit testing.

    When writing tests it is sometimes difficult to get the balance right between overspecifying the
    test (and making it brittle to changes), and not specifying enough (making the test less
    valuable since it continues to pass even when the thing being tested is broken). Having a tool
    that allows you to pick out precisely the aspect under test and describe the values it should
    have, to a controlled level of precision, helps greatly in writing tests that are "just right."
    Such tests fail when the behavior of the aspect under test deviates from the expected behavior,
    yet continue to pass when minor, unrelated changes to the behavior are made.


    @section platforms Cocoa and iOS

    OCHamcrest is supported for both Cocoa and iOS development.

    @b Cocoa:
    @li Add @b OCHamcrest.framework to your project.
    @li Add a Copy Files build phase to copy OCHamcrest.framework to your Products Directory. For
        unit test bundles, make sure this Copy Files phase comes before the Run Script phase that
        executes tests.
    @li Add @code
#define HC_SHORTHAND
#import <OCHamcrest/OCHamcrest.h>
    @endcode

    @b iOS:
    @li Add @b OCHamcrestIOS.framework to your project.
    @li Add \e "-lstdc++" and \e "-ObjC" to your "Other Linker Flags".
    @li Add @code
#define HC_SHORTHAND
#import <OCHamcrestIOS/OCHamcrestIOS.h>
    @endcode


    @section firsttest My first OCHamcrest test

    We'll start by writing a very simple Xcode unit test, but instead of using OCUnit's
    @c STAssertEqualObjects function, we'll use OCHamcrest's @c assertThat construct and a
    predefined matcher:

    @code
#import <SenTestingKit/SenTestingKit.h>

#define HC_SHORTHAND
#import <OCHamcrest/OCHamcrest.h>

@interface BiscuitTest : SenTestCase
@end

@implementation BiscuitTest

- (void)testEquals
{
    Biscuit* theBiscuit = [Biscuit biscuitNamed:@"Ginger"];
    Biscuit* myBiscuit = [Biscuit biscuitNamed:@"Ginger"];
    assertThat(theBiscuit, equalTo(myBiscuit));
}

@end
    @endcode

    The @ref assertThat function is a stylized sentence for making a test assertion. In this
    example, the subject of the assertion is the object @c theBiscuit, which is the first method
    parameter. The second method parameter is a matcher for @c Biscuit objects, here a matcher that
    checks one object is equal to another using the @c -isEqual: method. The test passes since the
    @c Biscuit class defines an @c -isEqual: method.

    OCHamcrest's functions are actually declared with an "HC" package prefix (such as
    @c HC_assertThat and @c HC_equalTo) to avoid name clashes. To make test writing faster and test
    code more legible, shorthand macros are provided if @c HC_SHORTHAND is defined before including
    the OCHamcrest header. For example, instead of writing @ref HC_assertThat, simply write
    @ref assertThat.


    @section predefined Predefined matchers

    OCHamcrest comes with a library of useful matchers:

    <ul>
    <li>Object</li>
        <ul>
        <li>@ref equalTo - match equal object</li>
        <li>@ref hasDescription - match object's @c -description</li>
		<li>@ref hasProperty - match return value of method with given name</li>
        <li>@ref instanceOf - match object type</li>
        <li>@ref conformsToProtocol - match object protocol conformance</li>
        <li>@ref nilValue, @ref notNilValue - match for @c nil, or not @c nil</li>
        <li>@ref sameInstance - match same object</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Number</li>
        <ul>
        <li>@ref closeTo - match number close to a given value</li>
        <li>@b equalTo&lt;TypeName&gt; - match number equal to a primitive number (such as @ref equalToInt for an @c int)</li>
        <li>@ref greaterThan, @ref greaterThanOrEqualTo, @ref lessThan, @ref lessThanOrEqualTo - match numeric ordering</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Text</li>
        <ul>
        <li>@ref containsString - match part of a string</li>
        <li>@ref endsWith - match the end of a string</li>
        <li>@ref equalToIgnoringCase - match the complete string but ignore case</li>
        <li>@ref equalToIgnoringWhitespace - match the complete string but ignore extra whitespace</li>
        <li>@ref startsWith - match the beginning of a string</li>
        <li>@ref stringContainsInOrder - match parts of a string, in relative order</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Logical</li>
        <ul>
        <li>@ref allOf - "and" together all matchers</li>
        <li>@ref anyOf - "or" together all matchers</li>
        <li>@ref anything - match anything, useful in composite matchers when you don't care about a particular value</li>
        <li>@ref isNot - negate the matcher</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Collection</li>
        <ul>
        <li>@ref contains - exactly match the entire collection</li>
        <li>@ref containsInAnyOrder - match the entire collection, but in any order</li>
        <li>@ref empty - match empty collection</li>
        <li>@ref hasCount - match number of elements against another matcher</li>
        <li>@ref hasCountOf - match collection with given number of elements</li>
        <li>@ref hasEntries - match dictionary with list of key-value pairs</li>
        <li>@ref hasEntry - match dictionary containing a key-value pair</li>
        <li>@ref hasItem - match if given item appears in the collection</li>
        <li>@ref hasItems - match if all given items appears in the collection, in any order</li>
        <li>@ref hasKey - match dictionary with a key</li>
        <li>@ref hasValue - match dictionary with a value</li>
        <li>@ref onlyContains -  match if collections's items appear in given list</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Decorator</li>
        <ul>
        <li>@ref describedAs - give the matcher a custom failure description</li>
        <li>@ref is - decorator to improve readability - see @ref sugar, below</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    The arguments for many of these matchers accept not just a matching value, but another matcher,
    so matchers can be composed for greater flexibility. For example,
    <tt>only_contains(endsWith(\@"."))</tt> will match any collection where every item is a string
    ending with period.


    @section sugar Syntactic sugar

    OCHamcrest strives to make your tests as readable as possible. For example, the @ref is matcher
    is a wrapper that doesn't add any extra behavior to the underlying matcher. The following
    assertions are all equivalent:

    @code
assertThat(theBiscuit, equalTo(myBiscuit));
assertThat(theBiscuit, is(equalTo(myBiscuit)));
assertThat(theBiscuit, is(myBiscuit));
    @endcode


    @section custom Writing custom matchers

    A key feature of OCHamcrest is its extensibility. See @ref custom-matchers for an example of how
    to write your own matchers.
